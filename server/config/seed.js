Because the sections are so large, any activity in which 1L students participate will inevitably have fellow sectionmates, and the tendency to stick with these new friends and cohorts is quite difficult to overcome. Some of HLS's policies and programs, rather than working against this tendency, actually reinforce it. For instance, each section has $12,000 to spend on activities. These activities are sometimes open to the public (for instance, lectures), but are more often insulated by section. HL Central's 1L Cup, which pits the seven 1L sections against one another in cookie-eating, balloon-popping, and pretzel-passing contests, brings the whole class together, but in a way that solidifies bonds within each section and not among them. Still, this section camaraderie, by and large, is a positive aspect of life at Harvard Law School. Section parties and other get-togethers are frequent and provide a chance for extensive social interaction for even the shiest of law students. Upper-class students say that they have stayed friends with their former sectionmates, and professors and students alike note that one's section fellows will serve as career contacts in the future.",

        writeUp: "At WNA we encourage your child to explore â€” to create â€” to learn new concepts. Learning by doing motivates preschoolers. The curriculum at WNA is well-rounded â€” art, music, iPads, even sustainable gardening take their place next to language, math and social studies. Learning is meant to be fun at WNA. From Preschool to Elementary and Intermediate grades (up to grade 8), our students are taught important life skills in a safe, nurturing Christian environment. Our goal is to expand their knowledge and skills while creating lifetime experiences. We understand how hard you work in order to provide for your family and to give your child a quality education. With that in mind, WNA makes every attempt to keep tuition at a reasonable level, lower than comparable Christian schools in the community. Windward Nazarene Academy provides a healthy, moral education, always keeping in mind that each child is unique. Faith-based values are incorporated into the curriculum, a balanced program designed to answer the curiosity of young minds while giving children the confidence to explore; to build strong relationships and grow to be solid, productive, grace-filled members of their families and society. These have been the goals of our preschool since 1967 and continue as we go forward.",
